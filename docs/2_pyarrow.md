# Why PyArrow?

## Role in the pipeline

PyArrow is used to write and read **Parquet files** in the landing area (`landing/cfpb_complaints/`). It serves as the bridge between API extraction and DuckDB loading.

```
CFPB API -> extract_complaints() -> PyArrow writes Parquet -> PyArrow reads Parquet -> dlt loads to DuckDB
```

## Why Parquet?

Columnar format: Efficient storage and fast analytical reads
Schema preservation: Data types are encoded in the file, no CSV parsing ambiguity
Compression: Parquet files are significantly smaller than JSON/CSV equivalents
DuckDB native support: DuckDB can read Parquet files directly via read_parquet()

## Why PyArrow (vs alternatives)?

| **Option** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|-|-|-|
| **PyArrow** | Zero new dependencies (transitive dep of dlt + duckdb), fast, full Parquet support | Slightly verbose API |
| pandas | Familiar API	| Would add a heavy dependency just for file I/O |
| fastparquet | Lightweight | Extra dependency, less maintained |
| DuckDB COPY | No Python intermediary | Doesn't help with writing from API data |

## Usage in the Codebase

**Writing (`save_to_parquet`)**: 

```python
import pyarrow as pa
import pyarrow.parquet as pq

table = pa.Table.from_pylist(records)
pq.write_table(table, file_path)
```

**Reading (`load_parquet_to_duckdb`)**:

```python
table = pq.read_table(parquet_path)
records = table.to_pylist()
```

## File Location

Parquet files are written to:

```
landing/cfpb_complaints/{company}_{date_min}_{date_max}.parquet
```

These files are gitignored and serve as a local staging area for debugging, archival, and replayability.
